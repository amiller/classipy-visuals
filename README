Classification Results Displays

Requirements:
  - django.template


Generate an HTML output showing the most challenging images and comparing different runs and features

Usage:
  python classify_diff.py

  This script assumes
   - JPEGImages/ is a symlink to the vocdevkit/voc2007/JPEGImages directory.
   - pickles/ is a directory containing the relevant run results

  Names of the run results will be passed to the command line, but for now they are defaults in the script.


Alternate usage:
  python serve_classify_diff.py

  This serves the html generated by classify_diff.py on localhost:8080
  It makes the same assumptions as above
